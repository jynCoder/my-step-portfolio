        Hi,
        I am Dalen Witthoft and I am a rising sophmore at Boston University. I am majoring in 
        Computer Science, but also have a passion for learning languages and about other cultures. I 
        am currently studying Japanese and plan on expanding to Korean and Chinese before I graduate.
        In my free time I love playing video games, watching anime, and watching K-Dramas. I also enjoy 
        checking out what is going on in the competetive coding world as I did that throughout highschool. I
        always find it interesting to see what strategies the top comptetive coders use to solve problems and 
        see if I can adapt any of those approaches to my school work or personal projects. Thanks for checking out
        my About Me website. :)
    </p>
